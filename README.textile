h3. What is it?

This extension is a port of Reddit Minimal for Safari, created by "Cornell Campbell":http://cornellcampbell.com/extensions/.

h3. Why would I need it?

In general, it cleans your Reddit page. Just check the two images on "Campbell's website":http://cornellcampbell.com/extensions/ and you'll understand.

h3. How do I install it?

You can just download the .crx from my "Dropbox":https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ctofyhgp4k0pnyf/Reddit-Minimal-for-Chrome.crx?dl=1 or you can download the source from github and load it unpacked on Chrome.

h3. I love it but would you add/fix 'that'?

Just open an issue on Github and I will fix/add it if it makes sense.

I'm not the original creator of this extension, all credit goes to Campbell. I just ported it for Chrome because I needed it.
